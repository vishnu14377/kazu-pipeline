  "Summary": "Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) is an antibody-linked drug conjugate (ADC), developed by Seagen (formerly Seattle Genetics) for the treatment of haematologic malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD) and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) expressing CD30, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). It consists of an anti-CD30 MAb (SGN-30) attached to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-sensitive linker (Company Web Page, Seattle, 28 Oct 2002; Press release, Seattle, 24 Jul 2009). Auristatin E is a synthetic analogue of the natural product dolastatin-10, and prevents cell division by the inhibition of tubulin polymerization. A previous lead in the series, SGN-25, was under development for carcinoma (Company Web Page, Seattle, 14 Jun 2002). Brentuximab vedotin also previously showed potential in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (Company Web Page; 28 Oct 2002). A companion diagnostic has been co-developed with brentuximab vedotin to evaluate CD30 expression levels in tissue specimens (Press release, Takeda, 12 Apr 2012; Company pipeline, Seagen, 9 Oct 2019 & 5 May 2023, https:\/\/www.seagen.com\/science\/pipeline). It was previously under development for HIV (JP Morgan 40th Ann Healthcare Conf (Virtual), 2022, Slide 8 & 26, https:\/\/s21.q4cdn.com\/327105422\/files\/doc_presentations\/2022\/Seagen-2022-JPM-Presentation-Final.pdf).",

  "Summary": "Cabazitaxel (XRP-6258) is a semisynthetic 10-deacetylbaccetin III, a taxoid, developed by Sanofi (Aventis before the merger) for the treatment of prostate cancer (Direct communication, Aventis, 20 Jul 2000; Company presentation, Sanofi-Aventis, 31 May 2005). Development for breast cancer was discontinued (Scrip Daily Online, 11 Feb 2009, S01019946). Cabazitaxel inhibits cell proliferation by inducing a sustained mitotic block at the metaphase\/anaphase boundary and forming an incomplete metaphase plate of chromosomes, whilst stabilizing microtubules by shifting the dynamic equilibrium between tubulin dimers and microtubules towards polymerization (16th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symp Molec Targ Cancer Ther (Geneva), 2004). It is the back-up compound to RPR-109881A (qv) (R&D Day, Aventis, 18 Jun 2002).\n Based on the results of the FIRSTANA Phase III study, the company decided not to submit Jevtana as a 1st line therapy. It is currently used as a second line therapy, and the FIRSTANA study was carried out to meet FDA post-marketing requirements (Half Yr Rep, Sanofi, 30 Aug 2016, Page 44, http:\/\/en.sanofi.com\/Images\/48415_Half_Year_Financial_Report_2016.pdf).",

It increases the level of oxidative stress in cancer cells beyond sustainable levels, inducing apoptosis (Press release, Synta, 14 Oct 2008). Development was previously focused on a free acid form; however, a water soluble salt formulation was formulated to avoid additional toxicology associated with the organic solvents required for dissolving free acids. An oral formulation may be developed (Form 10-K, Synta, 2006). Differences between Phase II and III trial results will be examined when deciding further development (Scrip Daily Online, 16 Mar 2009, S01022700).\n Development was previously suspended; however, the US FDA approved the resumption of clinical development (Press release, Synta, 2 Mar 2010).",

However the development for prostate cancer has been reinitiated (Company Web Page, Cell Genesys, 4 Nov 2008; Press release, BioSante, 3 May 2010).

The vaccines employ ex vivo transfection of autologous or allogeneic tumour cells with the GM-CSF gene, followed by ex vivo lethal irradiation before administration to the patient. For autologous therapy, adenoviral gene delivery is used upon tumour resection. A standardized allogeneic product using retroviral gene delivery is in development (Company communication, Cell Genesys, Dec 1993; Scrip, 1997, 2265, 27).\n GVAX prostate cancer vaccine is an off-the-shelf, non-patient-specific vaccine (Press release, BioSante, 3 May 2010).

  "Summary": "Onyx Pharmaceuticals (now Amgen) has discontinued development of lontucirev (ONYX-015; CI-1042), a recombinant mutant oncolytic adenovirus anticancer agent, to allow the company to focus on Bay-43-9006 (qv) (Press release, Onyx, 27 Jan 2003). It is modified so that it cannot produce the protein E1B (which in wild-type virus inactivates p53 to allow viral replication) and therefore cannot disarm the p53 system when it infects normal cells. However, in the majority of cancer cells, p53 is already disarmed through mutation of the p53 gene. When lontucirev infects these cells, the virus growth cycle proceeds unchecked, and cancer cells are killed through the pathogenic effects of adenovirus infection (Press release, Onyx, Apr 1996; Scrip, 1996, 2096, 26; Direct communication, Valentis, 9 Mar 2000). Onyx is also constructing ATM viruses (qv) with a lontucirev backbone for gene therapy (5th Meet Am Soc Gene Ther (Boston), 2002, Abs 309).",

It was previously under development under the names Arthrovas (for RA and OA, now discontinued), Neoretna (macular degeneration) and Psovascar (psoriasis) (Direct communication, AEterna, 13 Mar 2001). It is an antiangiogenic compound with antitumour and antimetastatic properties which inhibits specific MMPs and interacts with VEGF receptors.",

It also has potential as a tumour chemosensitizer in haematological malignancies and solid tumours, and in solid organ transplantation, autoimmune disease and vascular disease (Ann Rep, Genzyme, 2008). It binds to the CXCR4 receptor (Press release, AnorMED, Apr 1997; Scrip 1998, 2301, 19). It was previously under development for HIV, but was discontinued for this indication as it did not meet the criteria for efficacy in its Phase Ib\/IIa trial and caused abnormal cardiac activity in 2 patients (Press releases, AnorMED, 25 May 2001 & 25 Feb 2002).
