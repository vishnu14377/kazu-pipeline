## Cohort Definition Description
source: O184
hashTag: #ASSURE, #Indication, #ASSURE-Indication;
submitter: Gowtham A. Rao, Azza A Shoaibi
logic: all events of positive SAR-CoV-2 test result or Covid-19 diagnosis without a negative test result on to 3 days after diagnosis. Entry events will be combined into cohort eras if they are within 180 days of each other. cohort end date is 3 days post index.Â 


## Clinical Description
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

## Human Readable Algorithm
### Cohort Entry Events

People enter the cohort when observing any of the following:

1. measurements of 'SARS-CoV-2 test', starting after December 1, 2019; with value as concept: "detected", "detected", "positive", "positive", "present" or "present".

2. condition occurrences of 'COVID-19', starting after December 1, 2019; having no measurements of 'SARS-CoV-2 test', starting between 0 days before and 3 days after 'COVID-19' start date; with value as concept: "negative", "not detected", "not detected in pooled specimen", "absent", "negative", "not detected" or "absent".

### Cohort Exit

The cohort end date will be offset from index event's start date plus 3 days.

### Cohort Eras

Remaining events will be combined into cohort eras if they are within 180 days of each other.
