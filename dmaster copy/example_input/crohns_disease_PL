Logic: Earliest occurrence of Crohn’s disease indexed on diagnosis date, for the first time in history; cohort exit is the end of continuous observation.

Clinical Description
Crohn'a disease (CD) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any portion of the intestinal tract with focal, asymmetric, transmural, and granulomatous inflammation [1-3].

Crohn's disease is characterized by chronic inflammation that may extend through all layers of the intestinal wall, involving the mesentery and regional lymph nodes.
Intestinal involvement is discontinuous; "skip areas" of apparently normal tissue separate severely involved segments.
Reported incidence varies geographically, ranging from 0-20.02 cases per 100,000 person-years in North America and 0.3-12.7 cases per 100,000 in Europe.
Reported prevalence is highest in Europe (322 cases per 100,000 persons in Germany) and North America (319 cases per 100,000 persons in Canada).
Risk factors include smoking, diet, and genetic factors.
Evaluation Summary
We developed a prevalent cohort definition for Crohn’s disease (CD) using a concept set of two concepts which incorporated all those found from the literature review and from the analysis of PHOEBE and orphan concepts in cohort diagnostics.

The algorithm retrieves subjects from all 11 databases tested.

We developed a more specific cohort requiring a second diagnosis code for CD in the time period 31-365 days after index.

This cohort improves the specificity of the algorithm albeit at the expense of sensitivity as determined by PheValuator.
The 31-365 day period was determined to improve specificity compared to a 1-30 day or 1-60 day post-index second code requirement.
The significant loss in sensitivity, however, precludes its use in ASSURE.
Human Readable Algorithm
Cohort Entry Events
People enter the cohort when observing any of the following:

Condition occurrence of ‘Crohn’s disease’ for the first time in the person’s history.
Limit cohort entry events to the earliest event per person.
Cohort Exit
The person exits the cohort at the end of continuous observation.
Cohort Eras
Remaining events will be combined into cohort eras if they are within 0 days of each other.
