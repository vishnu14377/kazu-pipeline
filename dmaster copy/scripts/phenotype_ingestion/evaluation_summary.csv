10616,"development_process","We developed a prevalent cohort definition for Crohn's disease (CD) using a concept set of two concepts which incorporated all those found from the literature review and from the analysis of PHOEBE and orphan concepts in cohort diagnostics.","PhenotypeIngestionAgent","PhenotypeLibrary","2024-03-19T00:00:00Z"

10616,"algorithm_refinement","We developed a more specific cohort requiring a second diagnosis code for CD in the time period 31-365 days after index.","PhenotypeIngestionAgent","PhenotypeLibrary","2024-03-19T00:00:00Z"
10616,"performance_metrics","This cohort improves the specificity of the algorithm albeit at the expense of sensitivity as determined by PheValuator. The 31-365 day period was determined to improve specificity compared to a 1-30 day or 1-60 day post-index second code requirement. The significant loss in sensitivity, however, precludes its use in ASSURE.","PhenotypeIngestionAgent","PhenotypeLibrary","2024-03-19T00:00:00Z"
